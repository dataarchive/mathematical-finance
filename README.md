# My Past Teaching Materials for Mathematical Finance

I wrote these notes hoping that after this class, students can understand the idea behind portfolio choice rather than solving differential equations mechanically since computers are much better at the latter than most human beings. My notes include necessary background knowledge in probability and optimization, which I learned from other classes (e.g., Prof. Chen's probability theory at Peking University, Prof. Kadan's stochastic calculus, and Prof. Mukai's optimization at WashU).

My notes are mainly based on my teaching slides, which I first prepared in spring 2017 and revised a few times based on students' feedback. In 2019, these notes were integrated into Prof. Hong Liu's lecture notes.
